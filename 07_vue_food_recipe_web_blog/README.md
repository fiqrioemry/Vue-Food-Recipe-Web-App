# VUE simple Food recipe Web App with API 

A lightweight and user-friendly food recipe web application built using Vue.js. This project fetches recipe data from an API, providing users with an intuitive way to browse, search, and view detailed recipes. Designed with modern aesthetics, the app leverages Tailwind CSS and shadcn for responsive and visually appealing UI components.

This was my first time using vue and create this simple project as a practice. I use the design from random free figma UI website design the source from : https://www.figma.com/design/qi8OysEXeFbC0qKnI3AqjY/food-Recipe-Website-Ui-Kit-(Community)?node-id=1-57&node-type=canvas&t=kWKsClofZIbM8cp3-0 and https://dribbble.com/shots/23799483-Flavoriz-Food-Recipes-Website-UI-Figma-Template#

## Features
